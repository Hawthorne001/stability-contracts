# Stability Platform contracts

Stability is asset management, liquidity mining and yield farming platform. Users can deposit funds to vaults that built by other users.
Vaults use tokenized developed asset management strategy logic.

**Contracts are currently being developed. Alpha version is not deployed yet.**

## Strategy development

See the unified list of implemented strategies and those proposed for implementation on the [Strategies](https://book.stabilitydao.org/strategies.html) page in the [Stability Book](https://book.stabilitydao.org).

You can learn how to develop strategies for the platform by reading the [guide](./src/strategies/README.md).
